## Goal

This repository contains code for the software portion of the project.
The project aims to create a device easily fitted to chairs that will remind the user to take breaks rather that sit for extended periods of time.
By doing so, hopefully strain and posture injuries can be reduced among workers who sit and use a computer for much of their job.
